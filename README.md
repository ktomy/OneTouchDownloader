OneTouchDownloader
==================

This small projects helps you to download glucose readings form Lifescan OneTouch and Fora (TaiDoc) gluometers

I have written it for myself to be able to export data from devices to ms-excel

Tested with:
- Lifescan OneTouch Select Mini
- Fora G31b (with bluetooth)

should work on most of Lifescan OneTouch devices and on most of Fora and TaiDic glucometers.
